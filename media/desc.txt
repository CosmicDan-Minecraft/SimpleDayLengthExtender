A simple yet compatible mod to extend the day and/or night length in Minecraft.

The mod works by switching the doDaylightCycle gamerule on and off internally, without the need for command blocks (and without any log-spam). No changes to tick length, no changes to ticks-per-day.

- Works with TFC (TerraFirmaCraft) and probably all other mods (please report if not);
- Multiply the day and night length separately;
- Required on both Server and Client side (to prevent judder/desync)
- Can use arbitrary fractions, e.g. 1.5 or 50.25
- [Forge] Per-world config

Config is self explanatory and is named `simpledaylengthextender-server.toml`. For Forge, load into a world first and find the config under `[saves]/[WorldName]/serverconfig/` - you can edit the values then quit to title and re-load the world to apply new config :)

TODO:
 - Port to other MC versions
 - Support for SHORTENING day/night time (multiplier < 1.0)
 - Support for different dimensions and arbitrary phases (instead of just day/night)
 - Make this description nicer
 - Better logo
